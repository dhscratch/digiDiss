```
Relies on Javascript being enabled and AJAX - Should work in IE10 and up, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

[Corresponding theme](https://github.com/NEU-Libraries/digi-toy-wp-theme)

### Setup

1. Ask Karl for clean install of WP on correct server (will need to provide a directory name)

2. Log in to new Wordpress site as admin user

3. Install Quest theme (go to /wp-admin/theme-install.php and search for quest then click install)

4. SSH into correct directory on server and git clone this repo into wp-content/plugins

  ```
    git clone https://github.com/NEU-Libraries/digi-toy-wp-plugin.git digi-diss
  ```

5. Also clone the theme into wp-content/themes

  ```
    git clone https://github.com/NEU-Libraries/digi-toy-wp-theme.git quest-child
  ```

6. Register your site on google analytics and add your code to a git-ignored file called analytics.php

  ```
    cd /wp-content/themes/quest-child
    vi analytics.php
  ```

  Example file contents:

  ```
    <?php
      echo "<script>[YOUR GOOGLE ANALYTICS CODE]
      function add_google_tracking(){
        jQuery('.button').on('click', function() {
          ga('send', 'event', jQuery(this).data('label'), 'click', jQuery(this).data('pid'));
          console.log('send', 'event', jQuery(this).data('label'), 'click', jQuery(this).data('pid'));
        });
      }
      </script>
      ";
  ```

7. If you would like to override some of the functionality and styles or this child theme you may create a sub-directory named `overrides`.  This directory will be ignored by git and your changes won't be overwritten by future git pulls from the main repo.  Additionally, you can initialize this repository as a git-submodule and track your own changes in your own repo.

  ```
    cd wp-content/themes/quest-child
    mkdir overrides
    touch overrides/style.css
    echo "<?php //silence is golden" > overrides/functions.php
  ```

8. Delete extra themes to avoid user confusion

  ```
    cd wp-content/themes
    rm -rf twentyfifteen
    rm -rf twentysixteen
    rm -rf twentyseventeen
  ```

If you would like breadcrumbs on single pages/posts (not digi-dissitems) that reflect hierarchy, simply drag and drop the pages in the wp-admin pages screen to nest.

Moving a site to Production

1. Install additional plugins - WP Super Cache, Google XML Sitemaps, Warm Cache and enable all three

2. Go to Settings > WP Super Cache and select Caching on then Update Status

3. Go to Settings > XML-Sitemap and copy the URL for the sitemap

4. Go to Plugins > Warm cache and paste in the URL from above. This will generate a URL something like `http://domain.library.northeastern.edu/?warm_cache=jfido908234` Copy this URL and place it in the warm_cache.sh script located in /mnt/wordpressdata/warm_cache.sh on the production server. This is triggered on a cron job to warm the cache on production sites. (as root user - `00 1 * * * /mnt/wordpressdata/warm_cache.sh`)

If you have trouble with the loading digi-disscontent after initial install. Here are a few things to check:

* Check to make sure you have mod_rewrite enable (enable (`a2enmod rewrite`) and apache2/httpd restart(`sudo service apache2 restart`)). If you aren't sure if mod_rewrite is enabled, check `phpinfo()`

* Make sure the apache conf settings are correct. For your WP directory, you must have `Options FollowSymlinks` and `AllowOverride FileInfo` or `AllowOverride All`

* Make sure php5-curl library is installed. `sudo apt-get install php5-curl` and `sudo service apache2 restart`

* Check to make sure permalink settings are on and correct (ie. no index.php inside the path). If saving/resaving permalink settings does not work, make sure your .htaccess file in the root directory of your WP install is present and writable. For more on permalinks see [https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks).

* Check File permissions. In general WP directories should be 775 and files should be 664, with the exception of wp-config.php which should be 660. See [https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/proper-wordpress-filesystem-permissions-ownerships/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/proper-wordpress-filesystem-permissions-ownerships/) for more info.
